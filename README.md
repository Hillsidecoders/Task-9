Kubernetes Integration with Python-CGI

Task Description ðŸ“„

ðŸ“Œ In continuation of task 7.1 you need to Integrate Kubernetes commands that can be run through webUI created by you. 

ðŸ‘‰ This time create webUI page as such that using normal English conversation your all commands can run in background. 
Example - when we write 'run deployment using httpd image' then it run complete deployment command in backend. 

Feature necessary -

ðŸ‘‰ It can launch pods with specific name given by user. 

ðŸ‘‰ Run deployment using image and name given by user. 

ðŸ‘‰ Expose services on given user input port number. 

ðŸ‘‰ Scale the replica according to user need. 

ðŸ‘‰ Delete complete environment created. 

ðŸ‘‰ Delete specific resources given by user. 


Note - There should be webUI based menu display so that user can get to know what your webapp can do. 

ðŸ“Œ This app will help the user to run all the Kubernetes commands.

<b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION: </b>

This projects lets you run kubernetes command from the web browser even if you do not know the exact command.

-> Place the home3.html and the Color.gif files in /var/www/html/ directory and all the python files in /var/www/cgi-bin/ directory. [In RHEL8]

    Note: You may need to recreate all the python files and then convert then to executable using [chmod +x file_name] as 
    these python are already converted to executable file in our system and some settings may vary from system to system. 
    [Otherwise may or may not giving an Internal Server Error]

-> This project uses minikube VM for kubernetes services and RedHat 8 OS as the apache webserver host OS. [ In our case running on top of Virtual Box ].
You need to have the following setting in RedHat OS to configure the Web UI successfully

1. Have an apache server installed (yum install httpd)
2. disabe firewall [ Technically this step should be allowing various permisssions to public user however as this project is not security based so we used an unsecure round about way] (systemctl disable firewalld)
3.give apache root access through suoders (sudo gedit /etc/sudoers    :
  IN /etc/sudoers :
  
  
              ## Allow root to run any commands anywhere 
              
               root	ALL=(ALL) 	ALL

               apache  ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL
               
               
4. setenforce 0       [set SElinux mode from targeted to passive]



-> To use Your minikube VM as a client you need to copy the 'admin.conf' from sudo cd /etc/kubernetes/ [ minikube VM ] to sudo cd /root/.kube/ [RedHat 8 OS]
after renaming the file as 'config'.

You also need to change the server address in admin.conf file before renaming the file :

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 IN 'admin.conf' :        change               
 
            server: https://control-plane.minikube.internal:8443   
            
                                  to          
                                  
            server: https://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:8443            [ xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx is the IP address of your minikube VM ]
